        <h1>Preshow</h1>
        <p>
          “<a href="http://youtu.be/6Hc6lDaWako">Thirst</a>” is the
          title of the 1931 propaganda film created by the
          Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to scare
          voters into approving funding for a 400-mile long aqueduct
          from the Colorado River to the City of Los Angeles. While
          this boring political mind control film will not be
          screened, it is a good example of the zeitgeist of water
          scarcity and the deep seeded roots of the theme of “thirst”
          in California. The preshow will give some context to the
          past and present water struggles, hopefully enhancing the
          experience of the feature film. The original audience of
          <em>Chinatown</em> viewed a past water crisis while in the
          midst of their own water crisis; today in the future
          (relatively speaking), the crisis persists, and in the
          future, the crisis will likely persist.

          If you are interested in a more indepth look at Southern
          California's water resource
          history, <a href="http://www.monolake.org/mlc/outsidebox">read
            this lecture</a> given by Martha Davis at UCLA for an
          Environmental Symposium. Its a little out of date (1998),
          but she gives a nice concise history with an optimistic
          outlook on the future.

          CHINATOWN is a 1974 American neo-noir film, directed by
          Roman Polanski from a screenplay by Robert Towne, and
          starring Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. The film was
          inspired by the California Water Wars, a series of disputes
          over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th
          century by which Los Angeles interests secured water rights
          in the Owens Valley <a title="Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinatown_(1974_film)">[...]</a>

          JJ ’Jake‘ Gittes is a private detective who seems to
          specialize in matrimonial cases. He is hired by Evelyn
          Mulwray when she suspects her husband Hollis, builder of the
          city’s water supply system, of having an affair. Gittes does
          what he does best and photographs him with a young girl but
          in the ensuing scandal, it seems he was hired by an
          impersonator and not the real Mrs. Mulwray. When Mr. Mulwray
          is found dead, Jake is plunged into a complex web of deceit
          involving murder, incest and municipal corruption all
          related to the city's water
          supply <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071315/"
