          <p>KITSCH: We’ll kick off the night by looking at the many
            goofy cultural phenomena of the 50’s. We’ll see the
            contrast between the model citizen and repressed fantasies
            of b-movie oddities. If you arrive early we’ll be showing
            50’s home videos for a peek at the “real” 50’s.</p>

          <p>Badlands was the closing feature film at the 1973 New
            York Film Festival, reportedly “overshadowing even Martin
            Scorsese’s Mean Streets.” Vincent Canby, who saw the film
            at its Festival debut, called it a “cool, sometimes
            brilliant, always ferociously American film”; according to
            Canby, "Sheen and Miss Spacek are splendid as the
            self-absorbed, cruel, possibly psychotic children of our
            time, as are the members of the supporting cast, including
            Warren Oates as Holly’s
