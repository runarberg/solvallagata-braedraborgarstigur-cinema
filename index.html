          will be showing you <em>The Man Who Would Be
          King</em>. Easter is upon us. That means increased expenses
          (<em>is. rekstarkostnaður</em>). Some of our staff members
          (that is our AV-technician) need their holidays (or their
          holiday pay to be precise). Therefor there won’t be any show
          this week until the monday after easter.</p>

        <p>This week’s<strong> preshow</strong> theme is
          Colonialism. The selected clips will present the
          multidimensional grandiosity of the colonial mind composed of
          the self-righteous oppressor, self-proclaimed savior, humble
          servant, and a barrel of laughs. We are happy to announce
          that the preshow will include a delightful 1961 cartoon by
          power couple Charles and Ray Eames (we want to be just like
          them when we grow up!).</p>

        <p><strong class="feature">The Man Who Would Be King</strong>
          is a 1975 film adapted from the Rudyard Kipling short story
          of the same title. It was adapted and directed by John
          Huston and starred Sean Connery, Michael Caine, Saeed
          Jaffrey, and Christopher Plummer as Kipling (giving a name
          to the short story's anonymous narrator). The film follows
          two rogue ex-non-commissioned officers of the Indian Army
          who set off from late 19th-century British India in search
          of adventure and end up as kings of
          Kafiristan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Would_Be_King_%28film%29">[…]</a></p>
