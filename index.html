        <p>Born in Chile to Russian immigrants, educated in Paris, and
          conceptual conqueror of Mexico, Jodorowsky created a new path
          of surrealism through the 60’s and 70’s… and then doused that
          path in gasoline and fire, leaving us all burning, suffering,
          and screaming in his wake.  The Holy Mountain transcends the
          psychedelic film experience of the 70’s, challenging reality
          and the pursuit of redemption in a world of blood thirsty war
          and enormous enterprise.</p>

        <p>The Theif, a Christ-like figure, encounters The Alchemist,
          who leads him and 7 other power hungry leaders on a pilgrimage
          to the Holy Mountain. To reach the edge where land meets
          heavens, they must liberate themselves from their temporary
          mortal identities to obtain immortality and become gods.</p>

        <p>Jodorowsky’s work is simply incapable of being anything less
          than “challenging,” and The Holy Mountain is no cake walk. As
          stated in the trailer, “Nothing in your education or
          experience can have prepared you for this film.” Ripe with
          vulgarity, and soaking with enough sacrilege to make the Pope
          cry tears of blood, this film explores a journey to
          enlightenment from a dirty, scary and hauntingly familiar
          place. Coming out of an era where the answer to a film was
          commonly found in mind altering drugs and experimental
          spirituality, Jodorowsky still leaves us with few answers to
          the questions we do not even know how to ask. Still, and
          foremost, The Holy Mountain is a rich, visceral, humorous,
          provocative and sometimes straight up offensive visual
          experience, financially made possible by the likes of John
          Lennon.</p>

        <p>Reality is about to become rather debatable. Let us indulge
          in the illusion of it. Maybe it will all make sense after you
          cross this cult favorite off your bucket list. Maybe not. Who
          cares anyway? Not Jodorowsky.</p>
