    <section class="feature">
      <p>Born in Chile to Russian immigrants, educated in Paris, and
        conceptual conqueror of Mexico, Jodorowsky created a new path
        of surrealism through the 60’s and 70’s… and then doused that
        path in gasoline and fire, leaving us all burning, suffering,
        and screaming in his wake.  The Holy Mountain transcends the
        psychedelic film experience of the 70’s, challenging reality
        and the pursuit of redemption in a world of blood thirsty war
        and enormous enterprise.</p>
      
      <p>The Theif, a Christ-like figure, encounters The Alchemist,
        who leads him and 7 other power hungry leaders on a pilgrimage
        to the Holy Mountain. To reach the edge where land meets
        heavens, they must liberate themselves from their temporary
        mortal identities to obtain immortality and become gods.</p>

      <p>Jodorowsky’s work is simply incapable of being anything less
        than “challenging,” and The Holy Mountain is no cake walk. As
        stated in the trailer, “Nothing in your education or
        experience can have prepared you for this film.” Ripe with
        vulgarity, and soaking with enough sacrilege to make the Pope
        cry tears of blood, this film explores a journey to
        enlightenment from a dirty, scary and hauntingly familiar
        place. Coming out of an era where the answer to a film was
        commonly found in mind altering drugs and experimental
        spirituality, Jodorowsky still leaves us with few answers to
        the questions we do not even know how to ask. Still, and
        foremost, The Holy Mountain is a rich, visceral, humorous,
        provocative and sometimes straight up offensive visual
        experience, financially made possible by the likes of John
        Lennon.</p>

      <p>Reality is about to become rather debatable. Let us indulge
        in the illusion of it. Maybe it will all make sense after you
        cross this cult favorite off your bucket list. Maybe not. Who
        cares anyway? Not Jodorowsky.</p>
