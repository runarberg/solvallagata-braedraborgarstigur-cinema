        <h1>What is art?</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Friday March 14<sup>th</sup> at 8PM:</strong> Is it enough to call yourself an artist and your work art or is there some criteria? How is it that a Picasso painting or sculpture is only valued monetarily and aesthetically as a Picasso if some very respectable and certifiable collector recognizes it in their catalogue? Why is an architect an artist, but not the people who do the physical work? If you are interested in art and thinking about art, this show is for you! If you think art is nice to look at occasionally, but its mostly boring and weird, wait and see what we have planned for next week!

          <h1>Pre-show</h1>
          <p>For the preshow we will start with a clip from an American Game Show called What’s My Line? A humorous insight into the self-perception of Salvador Dali as well as a glimpse at the unusual notoriety reached by some artists. Next we will look at “High Steel” to compare another kind of creator of sorts, one who is by all means not considered an artist. I invite the audience to consider why that may be. Then we will take a look at a bonafide artsy-fartsy art film from the Canadian Film Board, a true artistic gem and arguably ahead of its time for 1968. Finally we will end the preshow on a lighter note and laugh along (or not) with Betty Boop. </p>

            This week we will feature
            <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487092/">Who the #$&amp;% Is
              Jackson Pollock?</a>. It is a documentary following a woman
            named Teri Horton, a 73-year-old former long-haul truck
            driver from California, who purchased a painting from a
            thrift shop for $5, only later to find out that it may be a
            Jackson Pollock painting. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_the_*$%26%25_Is_Jackson_Pollock%3F">Keep reading at Wikipedia...</a>
